Create your own theme folder, you can use default as base to begin.

Put in that folder your:

* Config files (for localhost, testing and production)
* Handlers (Python handlers)
* Routes (These routes will overwrite boilerplate's routes)
* Statics files (CSS, JavaScript, Images, etc)
* Templates (HTML files, email templates, error templates and SEO files templates)
